# Monthly-Progress-Tracker

Monthly Progress Tracker is a short example of showing progress of monthly based. you can enter figure on given date then it will draw on graph. I have used Room database and LiveData with history. so record are stored in database and LiveData will notify the changes and will refresh the graph with new data.
